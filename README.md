# PlayableOgre
Mod for Baldur's Gate 3 that allows you to play as a Ogre. Based on the great work of ShinyHobo and the great tutorial video by Padme4000, https://linktr.ee/dungeonsandsouls helped me fixed some issues in the previous version, now NellsRelo's Skeleton mod served as an example. Check them out on the discord of Larian Studios.
Known issue is the Jumping animation and the Portrait bugging.
